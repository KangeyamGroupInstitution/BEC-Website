          The Department of Civil Engineering, started in the year 2009, offers BE (Civil Engineering), ME (Construction Engineering & Management) & ME (Structural Engineering). 
          The department activities are planned with dual inputs from Industry and reputed academic bodies in the state. Also, the department strengthens its core activities periodically with inputs from industry, 
          civil engineers and contractors, some of whom are trustees of the Institution. In addition to regular academic activities, the department strives to transform students into a pragmatic Civil Engineer by 
          involving them in solving field problems with needed guidance from faculty members.

        <p >Civil Engineering, the profession of designing and executing structural works that serve the general 
          public, such as dams, bridges, aqueducts, canals, highways, power plants, sewerage systems, and other 
          infrastructure. The term was first used in the 18th century to distinguish the newly recognized profession 
          from military engineering, until then preeminent. From earliest times, however, engineers have engaged in 
          peaceful activities, and many of the civil engineering works of ancient and medieval times—such as the Roman 
          public baths, roads, bridges, and aqueducts; the Flemish canals; the Dutch sea defenses; the French Gothic 
          cathedrals; and many other monuments—reveal a history of inventive genius and persistent experimentation.</p>
